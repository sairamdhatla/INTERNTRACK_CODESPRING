**InternTrack**

Smart Internship & Job Application Tracking Platform

InternTrack is a student-focused web application that helps users track, analyze, and improve their internship and job application journey using structured tracking, analytics, reminders, and smart suggestions.

**Project Overview**

Applying to internships and jobs is chaotic — spreadsheets, notes, reminders, follow-ups, and no visibility into what’s actually working.

InternTrack solves this problem by providing:

A centralized dashboard for all applications

Automatic analytics on response and success rates

Deadline reminders and follow-up suggestions

Actionable insights to help students apply smarter, not harder

**Key Features**
**Application Management**

Add, edit, and track internship/job applications

Track application status (Applied, OA, Interview, Offer, Accepted, Rejected)

Attach notes, deadlines, and platforms (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.)

**Analytics & Insights**

Response rate and success rate analysis

Conversion funnel (Applied → Offer → Accepted)

Average response time tracking

Platform and role performance insights

**Smart Reminders & Notifications**

Deadline reminders

Follow-up alerts for inactive applications

Weekly progress summaries

Interview and status update notifications

**Smart Suggestions**

Where to apply more based on past success

When to follow up on stalled applications

Role and platform-based recommendations

One-click actions (mark done, snooze, dismiss, add notes)

**Why InternTrack Matters**

InternTrack helps students:

Understand what’s working and what’s not

Avoid missing deadlines and follow-ups

Make data-driven career decisions

Reduce stress during the application process

Instead of guessing, students learn from their own data.
